## Requirements

### Python

Please install python `>= 3.12` and `pipx` in your environment. This template uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the environment and dependencies.

```python
# install uv via pipx
pipx install uv

# sync dependencies
uv sync

# source python venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

This opinionated template uses the [`Fast API`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python API framework.

### Environment Variable Configuration

The application uses Pydantic's `BaseSettings` for configuration management in `app/config.py`, automatically mapping environment variables to configuration fields.

In CDP, environment variables and secrets need to be set using CDP conventions.  See links below:
- [CDP App Config](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-documentation/blob/main/how-to/config.md)
- [CDP Secrets](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-documentation/blob/main/how-to/secrets.md)

For local development - see [instructions below](#local-development).

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting Python code.

#### Running Ruff

To run Ruff from the command line:

```bash
# Run linting with auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Run formatting
uv run ruff format .
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting and formatting checks automatically before each commit.

The pre-commit configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Set up the git hooks
pre-commit install
```

To run the hooks manually on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### VS Code Configuration

For the best development experience, configure VS Code to use Ruff:

1. Install the [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) for VS Code
2. Configure your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
        "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
    },
    "ruff.lint.run": "onSave",
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
            "source.organizeImports.ruff": "explicit"
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration will:

- Format your code with Ruff when you save a file
- Fix linting issues automatically when possible
- Organize imports according to isort rules

#### Ruff Configuration

Ruff is configured in the `.ruff.toml` file

### Docker

This repository uses Docker throughput its lifecycle i.e. both for local development and the environments. A benefit of this is that environment variables & secrets are managed consistently throughout the lifecycle

See the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` for details

## Local development

### Setup & Configuration

Follow the convention below for environment variables and secrets in local development.

**Note** that it does not use `.env` or `python-dotenv` as this is not the convention in the CDP environment.

**Environment variables:** `compose/aws.env`.

**Secrets:** `compose/secrets.env`. You need to create this, as it's excluded from version control.

**Libraries:** Ensure the python virtual environment is configured and libraries are installed using `uv sync`, [as above](#python)

**Pre-Commit Hooks:** Ensure you install the pre-commit hooks, as above

### Development

This app can be run locally by either using the Docker Compose project or via the provided script `scripts/start_dev_server.sh`.

#### Using Docker Compose

To run the application using Docker Compose, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile service up --build
```

If you want to enable hot-reloading, you can press the `w` key once the compose project is running to enable `watch` mode.

#### Using the provided script

To run the application using the provided script, you can execute:

```bash
./scripts/start_dev_server.sh
```

This script will:

- Check if Docker is running
- Start dependent services with Docker Compose (Localstack, MongoDB)
- Set up environment variables for local development
- Load configuration from compose/aws.env and compose/secrets.env
- Verify the Python virtual environment is set up
- Start the FastAPI application with hot-reload enabled

The service will then run on `http://localhost:8085`

### Testing

Ensure the python virtual environment is configured and libraries are installed using `uv sync`, [as above](#python)

Testing follows the [FastApi documented approach](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/); using pytest & starlette.

To test the application run:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## API endpoints

| Endpoint             | Description                    |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `GET: /docs`         | Automatic API Swagger docs     |
| `GET: /health`       | Health check endpoint          |
| `GET: /example/test` | Simple example endpoint        |
| `GET: /example/db`   | Database query example         |
| `GET: /example/http` | HTTP client example            |

## Custom Cloudwatch Metrics

Uses the [aws embedded metrics library](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-embedded-metrics-python). An example can be found in `metrics.py`

In order to make this library work in the environments, the environment variable `AWS_EMF_ENVIRONMENT=local` is set in the app config. This tells the library to use the local cloudwatch agent that has been configured in CDP, and uses the environment variables set up in CDP `AWS_EMF_AGENT_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_EMF_LOG_GROUP_NAME`, `AWS_EMF_LOG_STREAM_NAME`, `AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE`, `AWS_EMF_SERVICE_NAME`

## Pipelines

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties)
